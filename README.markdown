## Programming with Nothing, in CoffeeScript

Today, I saw [Tom Stuart](http://experthuman.com/programming-with-nothing)'s talk / blog post [Programming with Nothing](http://experthuman.com/programming-with-nothing). Of course, I was completely fascinated by the exercise, and decided to re-implement it in CoffeeScript (normally, I would use JavaScript, but CoffeeScript's shorter function syntax was almost necessary for this project). 

So, that's pretty much it. I reordered the functions a bit, and used the math functions to abbreviated some of the number representations, but otherwise, it's pretty much a direct translation of Tom's work. I haven't yet tried to do the constant replacement part.

Let me clarify that I definitely don't understand everything here; some of the [Y-combinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator) is pretty crazy, for example. I just read through Tom's article and wrote/copied the code as I went. You can see Tom's Ruby code [in this Github repo](https://github.com/tomstuart/nothing).
